# First Fastai experience

In this post I had first experience the file called Is it a bird?
In this file basic deep learning is introduced as a completed file in which fast ai searches the internet for birds. Trains an AI on two different topics, 
birds and forests and then checks if the image in the folder is a bird.

The training of the AI consists of 3 epochs and 6 batches per epoch.
